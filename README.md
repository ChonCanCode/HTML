# HTML Database 

A go-to page for all the HTML materials that I have learned.

## Common Semantic HTML Tags
    <header>: Represents the introductory content or a set of navigational links.

    <nav>: Defines a set of navigation links.

    <main>: Specifies the main content of a document.

    <section>: Represents a section of content, typically with a heading.

    <article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed independently, like a blog post or news article.

    <aside>: Contains content that is tangentially relat ed to the content around it, like a sidebar.

    <footer>: Defines the footer for a document or a section, typically containing copyright information or links to related documents.

    <figure>: Encapsulates media content like images, diagrams, and code snippets, along with their captions.

    <figcaption>: Provides a caption for the content of a <figure> element.

## Tags
    <p>: Defines a paragraph of text.It is used to group blocks of text into paragraphs, which are typically displayed with some space above and below them to separate them from other content.
    
    <h1> to <h6>: Define HTML headings, which indicate the importance and hierarchy of the content. These tags are used to create headings of different levels, with <h1> being the highest level (most important) and <h6> being the lowest level (least important). They help structure the content logically and are crucial for accessibility and Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

## Elements
    <input/>: to create interactive controls in web forms that can accept user input. It is an empty element, meaning it does not have a closing tag and usually does not have any content. The appearance and behavior of an <input> element are determined by the value of its type attribute.

    Here are some common types of <input> elements:

    Text input: <input type="text" />
        Creates a single-line text input field.

    Password input: <input type="password" />
        Creates a single-line text input field where the characters are masked.

    Email input: <input type="email" />
        Creates a single-line text input field that validates an email address.

    Number input: <input type="number" />
        Creates a single-line text input field that accepts numeric values.

    Checkbox: <input type="checkbox" />
        Creates a checkbox that can be toggled on or off.

    Radio button: <input type="radio" />
        Creates a radio button that allows the user to select one option from a group.

    Submit button: <input type="submit" />
        Creates a button that submits the form data to a server.

    Button: <input type="button" />
        Creates a clickable button that can trigger JavaScript actions.

    Date input: <input type="date" />
        Creates a control for entering a date.

    File input: <input type="file" />
        Creates a file-select field and a "Browse" button for file uploads.
    
    <a> the anchor element, is used to create hyperlinks, which allow users to navigate from one web page to another or to different sections within the same page. It's one of the most fundamental and widely used HTML elements for web navigation.
        The <a> tag creates a link.
        The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
        The text between the <a> and </a> tags is the clickable part of the link.
        e.g <a href="https://www.example.com">favorite website</a>
    
    <span> is an HTML tag used to group inline elements in a document. It doesn't inherently apply any formatting or functionality to its content but can be styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.
